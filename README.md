*Export Config, Class Properties, and Routes to JS*

- **Compatible Kohana Version(s):** 3.0

## Description

The JSSettings module was made mostly to allow developers to use reverse 
routing in their javascript files.  I suppose that's only useful when you want 
to make an ajax call that does not degrade. The module also provides an easy 
interface to pass config items and class properties into js files. Careful not 
to send sensitive information like passwords!
